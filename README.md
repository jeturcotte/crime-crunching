# Crime Crunching
This simple project aims to derive statistical data from the huge raw crime record data freely available from the FBI.

# Legal Requirements and License
The software written here is licenses for free use and modification by anyone and everyone, of course, but the DATA itself has its own legal requirements, bent upon guaranteeing the privacy of anyone recorded within it.  Everyone has access to this data, but must agree to the agency's requirements before downloading it, and so it will not be included here.
